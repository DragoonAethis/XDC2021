# Editing the Sponsor Roll

You'll need [Krita](https://krita.org/). Open SponsorRoll.kra, and on the right you'll find layer groups with:

- Two sets of Headers (for Gold and Silver/Bronze) sponsors.
- Three sets of Logos (Google/Nvidia/Arm, Microsoft/AMD, Others).

Set the visibility of the layers you want, move elements around, export to the intended roll.

If you want to change common elements (background opacity, main sponsor logo), you'll have to export ALL variants.
